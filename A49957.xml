            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

There did I first conſider of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of the Canon of Scripture which is toucht upon in theſe Papers but might be much more amplified and adorned: had I more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy of abode and ſupplies of the yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Records of the firſt five hundred years that have happily ſurvived the flaming fury and rage of the barbarous Goths and Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals and other waſters of both the Eaſt and Weſtern Empire, which might have conduced to the compleating of ſuch a work. But we muſt wait the times of Divine Wiſdom in appointment of any ſuch happy ſeaſons to view thoſe deſirable monuments.</p>
            <p>But why print? and why on ſuch a ſubject?
<pb facs="tcp:53756:3"/>and why now?

Tho Preaching or Printing prevail but little with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate age, <hi>(Jer: 6.29.)</hi> though the Bellowes be burnt in the fire, and the lead conſumed which was appointed to purify the droſſy Oare: yet with <hi>Jeremy</hi> and <hi>Eſay,</hi> and <hi>Pau</hi> we must in our ſeveral ages keep on, where God opens the door of opportunity for us, tho <hi>Iſrael</hi> be not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, let the Labour of faithful Workmen wait for its reward from the Lord of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt. Tho we for our Labour of love be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as the ſhavings and off-ſconrings of all things to this day: tis but for this life: <hi>(1 Cor 4.13)</hi> tho all the filth and garbage of the tongues in the ſtreets of <hi>Aſhdod</hi> be flung into our Carts, we muſt carry away the burden patiently, and meekly wipe off the ſoile from our names and faces. Tho our preſence be a burden to many houſes, and our testimony leſs minded than the piping of Children in a Market place, <hi>(Luk 7.32.)</hi> yet our Lord commands us to

               </gap>le honour to their Profeſſion, or comfort to their Relations, or any ſweet quiet to their own ſpirit: I often pondered what ſhould be the bitter root of all this Wormwood and Gall, and being very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to deal in compaſſion, as having been under ſome tentations, I ſpake with ſeveral, and found upon conference theſe following to be the principal cauſes of this Bondage of Spirit.</p>
            <p>The
<list>
                  <item>1. Was great ignorance of the true nature of Faith, and of the main funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Truths of the Goſpel, which did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze me to find upon ſearch in ſo many glittering, talking, but indeed ſhallow Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors.</item>
                  <pb facs="tcp:53756:6"/>
                  <item>2. Another was the great Levity, Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Laxneſs of their lives, trifling out their precious time in fidling querks, tales and jeſts, to pleaſe ſome whoſe Trenchers they hang upon like the Paraſites in <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtus,</hi> not li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e the bleſſed People of the former age, who far outſhined us in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Converſation, and therefore in the brightneſs of their aſſurance.</item>
                  <item>3. Others I obſerved to be of a froward, perverſe, ill-natur'd, ill-conditioned, ſower humor, full of prate and unprofitable mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of words, cenſures, backbitings, hollowneſs of true friendſhip: often mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring at God, and quarrelling with their Superiors.</item>
                  <item>4. Others I perceived to be naturally of a fearful, timorous, wavering, inconſtant, ſuſpitious ſpirit, ever learning, and never coming to the knowledg of the Truth.</item>
                  <item>5. And to end, moſt people extream worldly, couvetous, full of ſordid, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaching tricks and cunning cheats in dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and unleſs for a ſhow, baſely backward to any excellent works of charity, and ſtrict in examining the poor, to find an evaſion which <hi>Jerom</hi> ſo complains of in ſome of his
<pb facs="tcp:53756:6"/>age. Such as theſe eat out the very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of godlineſs, and rob themſelves of the ſeaſon of meditation, <hi>Periclitatur religio in negotiis</hi> Piety is loſt in a crowd of worldly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs with theſe and the reſt I muſt declare that the holy Spirit of God delights not to hold communion, as being fiery or miry Spirits.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon in my retirements (I hope by the Grace of God) I pitcht my thoughts (when I could not be ſo publickly uſeful as formerly) upon the compoſing a ſmall Treatiſe of the genuine nature of Faith, and in a peculiar Chapter to ſhew the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual connexion of Sanctification of heart and life in every gracious Believer.</p>
            <p>In the management whereof, I thought it might not be inexpedient to lay its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation upon the Doctrine of the verity of the Scriptures in one Chapter, and of the Deity of our bleſſed Lord in a ſecond af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Preface; the former being the Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal object of Faith, &amp; the latter the perſonal.</p>
            <p>Now foraſmuch that in all Sciences there be certain Principles, on which their Theoremes and Maximes are built: we may conſider of the like in Divinity, that
<pb facs="tcp:53756:7"/>the Holy Scriptures, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, 16.) (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to make us wiſe to Salvation) are the only true Baſis and Foundation, on which all the great Doctrines of Holineſs and Happineſs do moſt firmly inſiſt. In particular that great point of Faith, which bears it ſelf on the new Covenant of Grace, revealed in thoſe ſacred Pages. I thought meet therefore briefly to endeavour the proof of this high point, that the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament are the undoubted Word of the living God; and thereby to be received with all veneration imaginable as the ſolid fundamental of true Chriſtianity, &amp; in ſpecial of the weighty Doctrine of Faith: And this I have the more willingly performed at the entrance of this Tract, that good Chriſtians may not (I hope) need to go otherwhere to draw: but have ſufficient to ſettle their Faith on this Foundation, tho it be more amply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged upon abroad.</p>
            <p>Now whereas it may be ſaid that Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are indemonſtrable, as in <hi>Mathematicks</hi> and other Sciences,<note place="margin">Suarez. <hi>5</hi> to. Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph. <hi>L. C.</hi>
               </note> we muſt underſtand that Maxim of the Principles of Eſſence
<pb facs="tcp:53756:7"/>and not of cognition or knowledg. It is ſo, as to the verity of Holy Scriptures, we cannot demonſtrate them any further (and tis enough) than that they are founded on the glorious Authority of the infinitely wiſe, true, and moſt holy God, as conſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious to the verity and excellency of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and publiſhed by his injunction, as the rule of life and means of communion with himſelf in eternal happineſs, The Lord hath ſpoken, and who ſhall not tremble? (<hi>Amos</hi> 3.8.) Oh that Majeſtick ſtile, (<hi>Ezek</hi> 14.4 <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) <hi>[Thus ſaith the LORD]</hi> makes Men and Devils to quake, and rottenneſs to enter into their Spirits, when God ſets it home upon their Conſciences.</p>
            <p>My Deſign then is to ſhew, that at the Revelation and Exhibition of the holy vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, that I may both ſatisfie and confirm weak Believers, and convince (if poſſible) ſcoffing Atheiſts, that there were ſuch migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Teſtimonies of their divine, original at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the diſpenſing of them to the Church and the World that may convince all of their Heavenly Off-ſpring! if perſons put not on the veil of wilful ignorance, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15.) detaining the truth in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs.
<pb facs="tcp:53756:8"/>And in the cloſe it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that Hyſtorical Faith well grounded is uſeful to true and ſaving Faith.</p>
            <p>There are then two principal points which did await their ſliding down from Heaven into the hearts of the illuminated Pen-men inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, and the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them to the People in their diſtinct Ages, which may be comprehended in the firſt Chapter.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The wonderful Oracles and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies mentioned in thoſe ſacred leaves, which have been punctually fulfilled in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Generations of the Church.</item>
               <item>2. The Divine Miracles above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the power of nature; exhibited at thoſe two great junctures, the delivery of the Law by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the promulgation of the Goſpel at Mount Zion. In the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this firſt Chapter, I intend (God willing) to treat ſomewhat of the conſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Canon of Holy Scripture, a Point much deſired by ſome, and may be of uſe to others.</item>
            </list>
            <p>In the ſecond Chapter, let us ſpeak to the Deity of our bleſſed Lord: which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the grand point of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb facs="tcp:53756:8"/>&amp; the very Foundation of the Church of God, as <hi>Nicephorus Callistus</hi> reports a Story of a deep Cave diſcovered at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> under the ruines of the old Temple (when the <hi>Jews</hi> by the permiſſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation of <hi>Julian</hi> to contradict the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of our Lord, would needs attempt to build it again, but were beaten off by Thunder and Lightning) where they found within it upon a Stone Pillar the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> fairly laid and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. Let the Patriarch protect the truth of the ſtory: I mention it alluſively to this great Truth that lies at the Foundation of the true Church, that the Deity of Chriſt the principal deſign of <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, is the only Rock laid by the Father in Zion, (<hi>Iſai</hi> 28.16.) without which our Faith ſinks, and all our hopes vaniſh. If that be a nullity, all is gone, Chriſtianity is a vain Profeſſion and our Bibles as to Chriſt and the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace of no value.</p>
            <p>Wherefore O <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of this true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion hold theſe two points inviolable as your lives <hi>[The verity of the Scriptures, and the Deity of Christ]</hi> Then may we ſafely and comfortably proceed to the main
<pb facs="tcp:53756:9"/>ſubject of this Diſcourſe, the nature of true ſaving Faith: which I have divided into ten Chapters, but ſhall inlarge principally on three or four, being the drift and ſcope of my writing to help the Joy of FAITH in thoſe poor hearts; who tho truly gracious, yet like young <hi>Samuel,</hi> cannot well diſcern the voice and preſence of Chriſt. And this my undertaking I beg the divine help and Grace to aſſiſt and proſper, extending my time and health after my late ſickneſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his bleſſed will, affording the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable influence of his loving counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>This Tract divides into two parts. The firſt containing the Foundation; the ſecond the more viſible ſuperſtructure about the nature of Faith. The firſt concluding with two Chapters, and the ſecond with ten.</p>
            <p>But whereas ſome may queſtion, what need any further on this Subject, wherein ſeveral have already travelled. I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne that Holy <hi>Luke</hi> thought meet (in his pure Greek) as to his handling that heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Subject of our Lords Life, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 1.1.) that though many had taken it in hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet he would ſet forth ſome things not
<pb facs="tcp:53756:9"/>mentioned by other Evangeliſts. Yea, how many in almoſt all ages have proſecuted the ſame points in Divinity with benefit and uſe to the Church, both in Commentaries and Controverſies? This conſideration incouraged theſe Lines to appear: having obſerved ſome further need of theſe Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, on which I mainly inſiſt, and were the great motive of my writing, and are but little toucht heretofore, and yet are very uſeful to choſen Veſſels; yea, the far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er number of the truly gracious Servants of God. To whom if you draw near, and can have the happineſs to come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them for their good (for they are ſhy &amp; aware of every approach) you may find their lives to hang in an anxious ſuſpence between fear and hope, and feed only upon ſome few gracious glimpſes, like the Beams from between <hi>April</hi> Clouds let down out of Heaven into their hearts to ſuſtain their Spirits from ſinking, and to preſerve from dying under grievous Fits of the palpitation of their hearts.</p>
            <p>To theſe I chiefly bend my Souls deſire
<pb facs="tcp:53756:10"/>and humbly beg the dewes of <hi>Zion</hi> upon theſe Meditations and Labours, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they nor I may ſaint under loſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of Mercy.</p>
            <p>And ſo I finiſh the Preface, and come to the Treatiſe it ſelf.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. One Argument that ſome mention, is their venerable Antiquity, which though it be no cogent proof, yet allowing that of an ancient, <hi>(quo quid antiquius, co verius)</hi> that Truth is elder than Error, I would not lay aſide the pains of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> and others, who prove that the writings of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> are ancienter than any the Heathen world can pretend to.

With ſuch exactneſs did they manage that Affair, that they had <hi>in numerato,</hi> punctually ſet down every word and every letter in the whole Bible,
<pb facs="tcp:53756:11"/>and did alſo ſet down which was the middle word and middle letter of the whole, and I think of every individual Book: which was indeed a high providence of God towards the conſervation of thoſe happy leaves; and I could heartily wiſh the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been ſo guarded by induſtrious and holy perſons in the primitive times. Nay it were well, if yet at this day ſome pious Rectors of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities</hi> and <hi>Schools of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> would take up the ancienteſt and pureſt Copies, and perform it at this time. The Maſorites did the work long after the firſt penning of them on purpoſe to preſerve it in their diſperſions.</p>
                  <p>But I proceed to other Arguments, As</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Majeſty of their Stile, that might juſtly make the <hi>

                  <p n="3">3. The Heavenly Harmony of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct parts, tho written in various Ages, and diſtinct places.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The ſelf-denial of the Pen-men, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering their own ſins and heart corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the follies and weakneſs of their neareſt and deareſt relations, which is not done by other Writers, as <hi>Thucydides, Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon,</hi> or <hi>Plutarch,</hi> or <hi>Livy,</hi> but eſpecially by Law-givers, which might diſparage their Government; as the compilers of the twelve Tables, or <hi>Theodoſius</hi> in his Codex, or <hi>Juſtinian</hi> in his Pandects, or other his Sanctions of the Civil Law.</p>

                  <p n="6">6. In the ſixth place, a principal argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be deduced from the Imperial Power and Efficacy on the Souls and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men; both as to conviction of ſin, ſuſtentation of wounded Spirits, and their conſolation under the darkeſt clouds and deepeſt confuſions, while we are in this valley of Dragons, which is the reaſon why truly gracious perſons wade and dive through Sickneſſes, Troubles and ſtrong anxieties; when wicked and ungodly men languiſh and periſh a thouſand times over and over, becauſe the former enjoy the ſweet influences of the Spirit of God in the promiſes of the Goſpel, to cool their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences and calm their ſpirits into a hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon ſerenity, and ſometimes tread upon the Asp and Dragon without any fear.
<pb facs="tcp:53756:12"/>By theſe and the like meanes the Scriptures confirm and aſcertain themſelves like ſelf-e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident principles: when the Spirit of God ſtrikes aſide the Curtains and Vailes of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and purges the Corruptions out of the minds of men.</p>

For as much as they are works above the power of nature, therefore all Nations ſtand ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing at ſuch mighty exhibitions of Gods Majeſty; ſuch as curing blind-born Perſons, the reſtoring the dumb and lame, who were ſo afflicted from the Mothers Womb, yea, reviving of many from death to life: are they not undeniable Teſtimonies, that ſuch a one that performs theſe, is a God, or tranſacted by the immediate aſſiſtance and preſence of God? whence we may very well infer, that what ſuch a one ſpeaks is to be embraced as by divine Authority. For that glorious Perſon, that manifeſts in his works ſuch heavenly and coeleſtial power, muſt be believed to be God, and a God of ſupream Truth and higheſt verity, as well as of ſurpaſſing power. For infinite power and truth are and can be centerd no where but in a God.</p>

                     <p>Many other wonderful Miracles tranſact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Prophets in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and thouſands by our Lord, and many of his Apoſtles in the new, are ſet down for the confirmation of the holy Oracles.

Such perſons as the <hi>Magi,</hi> are hinted by <hi>Laertius,</hi> ſome things mentioned by <hi>Celſus</hi> in <hi>Origens</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of his Heatheniſh Opinions, by <hi>Julian, Porphyry, Apollonius,</hi> &amp;c. who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to undermine the Authority of the Scriptures, have by the conduct of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſtrangely ratified it,<note place="margin">niceph.</note> as the Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſaid of <hi>Julians</hi> attempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build the Temple;<note place="margin">Mat.</note> it happened that not a ſtone was left upon a ſtone there, the anger of God, ſending Thunder and Lightning, and Ebullitions of fire out of the bowels of the Earth ſo violent, that all the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the old Temple were flung out to the deſtruction of many of the old Jewiſh Builders at that time.

                     <p>HAving by many Arguments (I hope) demonſtrated the Sacred Authority of thoſe ineſtimable volumes of Scripture: There yet remains an enquiry about the finiſhing of the Canon, or the compaſs of all the Books that are of Divine ſtamp and original.

                     <p>Whatſoever hath been hitherto ſaid, I rather incline to think, that this great work was not concredited to Angels, or any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, or Primitive Churches at firſt, but performed by the Majeſtical Authority, the Lord and King of his Church, and that he himſelf in his own perſon commanded the

                     <p>Whereas on the other ſide, how often
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53756:29"/>have we ſeen with joy and delight, this bleſſed Word of God to have comforted many a ſoul in the greateſt conflicts and agonies of death, whence it follows. that theſe effects muſt be the iſſue of divine power, &amp; that theſe writings are indeed the very Word of the holy God: ſince no other books or preachings do or can ſo rouze and ſtartle the proud conſcience of man. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that elſe we might juſtly wonder what the man ails that is ſo tormented, his heart raging like the troubled Sea, till the Allablaſter box of fragrant oyntment be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened out of the promiſes, and the balſome when poured into a ſcalded and wounded ſpirit, immediately aſſwages its pain, and ſinks the bliſters: which all the Divines and holy Orators in the world could never do, till the preſence of God ſtampt idea's of mercy and comfort, ſpeaking peace to the Soul. Whence we may ſweetly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that no other books can be received with any powerful convictive authority. but where in they agree with the tenor and canon of holy Scriptures: ſo that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever walks according to this rule,<note place="margin">

                     <p>I ſhall then finiſh this firſt Chapter with that inference, for which thoſe mediums were brought. That ſince Faith in Chriſt Jeſus is the very ſcope and deſign, the very ſum and ſubſtance of the whole Scripture: it follows, that the acting of Faith upon them (as the <hi>Doctrinal Object</hi> of ſuch divine original) is grounded on the holineſs and

Hence it is that in whatever he ſpeaks from his moſt holy mouth by Oracles or Prophets ratified in their authority from him, muſt be judged a great preſumption and impiety to call for a reaſon of any of his words or actions by bold and daring, and impudent creatures. For from the raies of truth ſtreaming from the immenſe and ſoul-dazling ſun of his verity flows all the certainty and ſtabiliment in the ſpirits of angels or men, to fix and ſettle us in our belief and obedience.</p>

It's true, that the doctrine of the Goſpel is a moſt faithful ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that is, a moſt certain and undoubted aſſertion full of grace and truth, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all acceptation or embracing <hi>(u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique ulnis &amp; in utraque cordis camera)</hi> in our moſt intimate boſomes: that Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners: But it requires almighty power of the ſpirit of Chriſt to bring us to the obedience of faith,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53756:40"/>But of this more (God granting) in the ſequel. Now I'le proceed about ſome things in the nature of Faith, to which end I may recount that good old ſaying of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> cited by ſome <hi>(Accipe &amp; ſignas)</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, that is, believe it, and thou feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to the truth of God. Thus <hi>Sarah</hi> act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Faith, judged him faithful who had promiſed, and attained the end of her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular truſt in the caſe whereunto God had ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>But not to dilate in generals, I might proceed to the hononymy of the term, and the various Synonymous expreſſions of it found in Scripture. I might from fathers and ſchoolmen, from confeſſions of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, and their commentaries, common places and Syſtemes from contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſial writings between us and the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> and from the many holy practical writers of our own on this very ſubject, raiſe a great pile or maſs of diſcourſe, and therein but <hi>actum agere,</hi> over and over with the ſame in ſome little varieties. But I forbear, ſince my chief end and ſcope is principally to erect and comfort broken, languiſhing ſpirits, that hang in ſuſpence as it were between the hopes of heaven, and the fears of hell: I would gladly put a Scripture ſtaff (even one of the ſtaves of the Ark within the Sanctuary) into the hands of every weary and heavy laden ſoul.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not then be nice or over-curious in handling this point under the diſtinct heads of definition or deſcription, or in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing it into ſeveral ſorts, and ſo
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53756:41"/>proceed to examine all the cauſes, effects properties, adjuncts, contraries, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral corollaries deducible from all: or the caſes of conſcience, doubts and objections afflicting troubled ſpirits; for they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable: but only treat upon ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars moſt practical and uſeful, either paſt by, or but lightly touched by others. As Doctor <hi>Boodt</hi> that learned Phyſitian, and of great requeſt with the Reverend Biſhop <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> was more pleaſed to write <hi>[de af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectibus ommiſſes]</hi> of caſes not handled, then to trouble the world with large bodies of Phiſick over and over. So ſhould all endeavour not to burden the church of God with ſwelling diſcourſes, wrought up into a cumberſome Tympany out of others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding, who have done worthily in their generations: but ſhould either add <hi>quid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi: or quid noviter,</hi> either ſomething new, that may increaſe chriſtians knowledg and grace, or after a conciſe and clear method, that may raiſe the fancy, ſortifie memory, and take with ſuch as are out of the church to help on their converſion. Though I am ſenſible of my own deficiency, and intreat a candid Reader to pardon what is here done out of a great thirſt and deſire to caſt in ſome mites for initiated believers, as may help I hope, and add to their faith, or the joy of faith, and ſupply ſomething of what is yet lacking in the faith of ſome weaker chriſtians, with whom we converſe in Ordinances. Divinity is an Ocean that hath neither ſhoares nor bottom, there is room enough without envy for every one to ſpread new Sails, and in continual tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53756:41"/>we may ſtill ſee more wonders of God in theſe Deeps.</p>

                        </note> I think with ſome of the School men, and ſeveral other Learned men of late, that there is no ſound

                     <p>This powerful and ſweet motion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the will of a believer by the ſpirit of God, may be happily ſhadowed forth by the inclination of the mind in perſons carried towards union in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-covenant. It is of God, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally little or no reaſon to be given of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their choices, but an influence or impulſe from heaven, in thoſe that out of pure and honeſt affection, give mutual conſent to that relation, and not for any baſe and ſiniſter ends, but for perſonal delight in each other: wherein that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted, intaminated love in rational be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſo vaſtly differs from bruitiſh luſts, and draws nigh to an Angelical Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, like that of an honourable Lady to a Philoſopher in <hi>Scotland,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Burton</hi> in his book of Melancholly. How much more and tranſcendently excellent is that joyful and heavenly love moving in the heart by the finger of God, in a ſoul that thirſts after ſpiritual eſpouſals to the Lord of Life.</p>
                     <p>There is no adumbration of our union to the Lord Jeſus, more proper or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent than this, wherein the Scripture doth ſo greatly delight.

                  <p n="2">2. They find and feel the inward bent of their ſoul to be towards God, the byas of the will alwayes inclined Heaven-ward, tho ſome rubs and hillocks may divert a while. They are like the Sun-flower ever turning to that glorious Lamp; or as the needle pointing to the Northern Pole. <hi>It</hi> may ſuffer ſome variations and ſupervaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and miſteries of Declination not hitherto fully determined to heip the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude: but in the main, its courſe bent and delight is toward that point of the compaſs.

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Again, There is in this new heart of fleſh, this covenant heart, an inward, ſweet ſenſibleneſs of that great ſtone of impenitence, that as yet remains unbroken in pieces, which with its ragged points and angles wounds, the tender fleſhy part, and makes it bleed with joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſorrow. The holy new convert is greatly ſenſible of its proud fleſh, and that heavy lump that hangs like a talent of lead at the feet: and the worlds bird-lime that ſticks to the wings of the ſoul, when it would mount up to heaven in holy duties. Or as perſons after a great autumnal fever, labour under a ſqueazy ſtomack, with a maſs of baked humours at the bottom.

It's a ſign of an unſanctified heart and a very proud ſpirit, to ſnuff and ſnarl at godly reproof. But this is a certain note of grace begun, when no corruption is too dear, no ſecret ſin ſo delectable: but
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53756:71"/>it will part with it at the conviction of the Spirit. Yea, and the more ſearching any Miniſtry is, the more it delights to ſit under it; &amp; dares not call that a legal preaching, which drives men out of the School of the Law, into the Temple of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Beſides, the tender ſoul grieves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its fears of the want of true Faith, and is never quiet, till it gain ſome lively hope of its implantation into Chriſt, which it cheriſhes and nouriſhes by the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of promiſes.

                  <p n="6">6. Again, This troubled ſoul flies far from the land of excuſes, hates palliations, and ſelf-conceited applauſes, and layes all the fault upon it ſelf: heaps accuſations, and layes ſnares and tentations for its own feet: and ſo great, that the holyeſt miniſter, and one skilful in caſes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, can hardly ſometimes anſwer and reſolve. Whereas the hypocritical Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee is commonly full of talk, hath little or no ſolidity, is confident and boaſts of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences with a falſe tongue and a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

But our gracious young convert is as ſenſible of the leaſt ſin, as the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hand hath a quick and immediate ſenſe of the ſitting of a flye, or the gentle brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things of a Weſtern Air. It laments over In-dwelling ſin, bewails its reſidence, and ſounds continual alarums againſt it. For it cannot bear the domination of that proud Vice-roy of Satan, to fullfil it in any luſts thereof. If it prevail though but a little, the ſoul triumphs as if its conquering flag were entring the gates of heaven. For although its motions and impulſes againſt unholineſs be yet but weak, tender and low; yet are they the fruits of integrity, and grow forward in Strength. This is a true ſign of grace, and that the new life is in good earneſt begun in that heart; for it finds repentance towards God, and true ſorrow for ſin, conjoyned with real incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, reſolutions and workings in its gradual turning from it, and an holy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of all thoughts of reverſion to it.</p>

Our Lord bids us therefore to go and learn this point more diligently: For a <hi>Phariſee</hi> may be huge ceremonius with his white linnen about a platter, but yet neglect the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty matters of the Law, Juſtice and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Mercy. Whereas true Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53756:79"/>is a work of Gods Spirit, renewing the whole man after the image of God in righteouſneſs and true holineſs: whereby he is inſtructed and inabled in all wayes of Scripture obedience, to mind the weighty and principal things of love to God and our Neighbour: and not leave undone thoſe leſſer points, which belong to any inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, and not of man.</p>
                  <p>By this inward work upon the heart, the ſanctified perſon immediately begins the practice of Mortification, in dying to ſin, and of riſing to newneſs of life: but yet this work is not perfectly and compleatly wrought in any perſon during this life: therefore we muſt interpret the Apoſtle in his prayer,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.23.</note> that the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> might be ſanctified throughout: not in the higheſt pitch of degrees, but of ſoundneſs and ſincerity in every part,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17</note> and member of the new <hi>Adam.</hi>

                  <p>THe nature of Aſſurance and Method to attain it, is the Subject of this Chapter. In former times, Faith was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented under the notion of aſſurance,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53756:89"/>or a Saints particular certainty, that Chriſt died for his own ſoul among the reſt of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. Like to that ſpecial priviledg to which <hi>Paul</hi> preſcribes,<note place="margin">

                        </gap>0.</note> that Chriſt loved him and died for him. But now, more diligent obſervation of Holy Scripture and experience hath cleared up this point; that aſſurance is the belief,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.</note> that we are juſtified by Faith in Chriſt and ſo have peace with God. It is the application of Faith, or a perſwaſion of our hearts concerning the love of God.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19.</note> When the Spirit of God ſets his ſeal upon our hearts with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the image of Chriſt as in wax or as the Antients graved the effigies of their Princes on a Cornelian or Opal, or ſuch precious Stones.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.23.</note> It produces a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of acceſs by Faith in Chriſt, and is daily more and more evidenced by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode of both Father and Son with us: when the ripe Grapes of <hi>Eſhcol</hi> are caſt into our boſoms, and Chriſt himſelf comes in to ſup with us.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20.</note> Aſſurance ſhines by a reflex beam of the ſouls eye upon it ſelf. When a Saint ſitting down in the cloſet of his own heart takes a clear view of his face in the glaſs of Faith. I may term it, a Saints belief of his own Faith. Aſſurance is the cream of Faith when tis ſettled: its the <hi>joy of Faith</hi> ſpringing in the Soul from the warm healing beams of the Sun of righteouſneſs riſing upon its humble val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys. Some take Faith to be a truſt on the promiſe for remiſſion of our own ſins in particular, or conjoyned with reliance, dependance, adherence and affiance. When having caſt all our hope and expectation
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53756:89"/>of heaven and happineſs into the arms of Chriſt alone; and thence infer the promiſe to have been made to us in particular, by an immediate conſequence drawn from our ſpecial and perſonal application of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite or more general promiſe, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it as a divine Oracle to us in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and therefore call it ſpecial Faith: the promiſe being thereby aſſigned to me im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately as certainly as to any in the world, becauſe I have ſet to my ſeal, that God is truth, and accepted him upon his Word. When this is done, to wait with joyful expectation, that God will perform it at the day of Chriſt. But what is all this any more than Faith and aſſurance tied up together in a bundle of ſweet ſmelling Myrrhe:<note place="margin">

                  <p>As to Argumentation:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> By Arguments drawn from our having and acting of Faith and the effects of it; we may obtain ſome meaſure of this bleſſed priviledg. Thus [Whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves in Chriſt, ſuch a perſons ſins are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and therefore ſhall be ſaved. But <hi>I</hi> believe, and therefore <hi>I</hi> ſhall be ſaved. The major Propoſition is expreſly the Word of God, and built upon the rock of eternity. The minor, which is [That <hi>I</hi> believe] muſt be wrought out and proved by the firſt Chapter of this Treatiſe, or any other holy Directions; and then upon examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be found in the ſenſe and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of thine own ſoul: and thence the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion will irrefragably and undeniably follow with unſpeakable comfort and full of glory. Now here a Chriſtian may ſee, how neceſſary it is to ponder diligently upon the true nature of Faith, and to underſtand its inward eſſence and actings in caſting the ſoul upon Chriſt, and likewiſe the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Faith from Aſſurance, and how aſſurance may be clearly and firmly built upon a ſound and a well-argued ſenſe of its being and acting in the ſoul. In the Looking-glaſs of Aſſurance the ſoul beholds it ſelf clinging and cleaving to Chriſt while he is ſupporting and carrying it over the

If a Ship be under Sail, and its Top-gallants out, ſhews its ſound eſtate, and makes way towards its Ophir. To be ſtrong and ſwift in motion demonſtrates a ſtrong and healthy ſoul, and is the way to keep it in a happy frame: for exerciſe conduces to health and Strength.

                  <p>Let us then mention the chief in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The firſt evidence of eternal life is drawn from our walking in the <hi>Light,</hi> that is, of holineſs, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.6. &amp; 2 29. &amp; 3.6, 9. walking in the truth, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3.3. in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Commandments, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.3, 5 &amp; 3.24. &amp; 5.2, 3. &amp; <hi>Epiſtle</hi> 2.6. In imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſts holy walking, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.6. &amp; 4.17. and in purifying of our ſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his pattern, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3. and yet all this muſt be qualified in reſpect to our infirmities and weakneſſes, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.8, 9, 10. &amp; 2.1, 2.</item>
                     <item>2. The ſecond Argument to prove the truth of grace, and aſſure our ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, is <hi>love to the Brethren,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.9, 10 and chap. 3.11, 14. &amp; 4.7, 12, 20. and in his Goſpel, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13 35.</item>
                     <item>3. The third Argument is from our not loving the World, nor the things thereof, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15. as <hi>the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes or the pride of life</hi> ver. 16.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>That is, 1. <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of all ſorts, as luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Diet, Habit, Houſes, Gardens, ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling about the World without ſpecial ends; and all inordinacy and intemperateneſs in the body, as <hi>Jerom</hi> uſes to expreſs it, <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The luſt of the eye,</hi> which is as to all ſorts of covetouſneſs, to get and retain by right or by wrong, in an exceſſive appeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the things of this World, which muſt be left behind us, and do not, can not fill the heart of man, no nor the eye with ſatisfaction.<note place="margin">

                  <p n="4">4. The fourth Argument is aſſumed from the anointings of their Spirit, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2: 20, 27 &amp; 3.24. &amp; 4.13. whereof more by and by God willing.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fifth Argument is taken from a holy and reverent hearing of Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.6. we may know what ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit we are of by this, if we receive Chriſt: as <hi>Hilary</hi> expreſſes it, <hi>[Qualis ab Apoſtolis praedicatus eſt]</hi> as he was preached by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and ſubmit to him in all his Offices and Ordinances ſuch a one belongs to the ſpirit, that is of God, that keeps the Doctrine of Chriſt as the Apoſtle expounds himſelf, <hi>Epiſtle</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The laſt Argument ariſes from our love to Chriſt, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.1. and in him to the Father.</p>
                  <p>Now if theſe things be found in us, we ſhall then overcome the World, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.4.

                  <p>Having hitherto treated about Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, I proceed now to the ſecond Head about attaining Aſſurance, which is by the irradiation of the Spirit of God upon the hearts of Believers. For all is in vain as to gaining of ſolid and permanent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, unleſs the Spirit of God come in and confirm us againſt the innumerable doubts and cavils that will ariſe upon us under all our Arguings, becauſe of the ſubtlety of ſatan, the natural diffidence of our own hearts, and the clouds that ariſe from the unholineſs of our lives, and the dread of eternity. I deſign therefore to treat a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while about the witneſs of the ſpirit, his immediate breathings, his bright ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and as it were ſpeakings within our hearts, when a holy ſoul hath this witneſs in himſelf.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.44.</note> For in and upon believing, the Father of Lights and of all conſolations ſends in his own due time, this his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit like a dove of peace into our hearts, who helps us to diſcern the truth of the work of grace.

                  <p>But <hi>I</hi> would ſpeak a little more diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for the obſervation and the experience of holy men hath ſet to their ſeals, that they do find and feel ſometimes a moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious irradiation upon their hearts from the Spirit of God: which <hi>I</hi> take to be of two ſorts;</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>The 1. We may call an irradiation of concurſe with our ſpirits.</item>

                  </list>
                  <p>The Firſt or the irradiation of <hi>concurſe</hi> is then diſpenſed when he ſhines upon our Argumentation: when we have laboured with our ſpirits, uſed ſcripture mediums, and upon examination ſuited them to our hearts in their moſt inward ſincere and humble ſearches; then comes the ſpirit of God, and witneſſes with our ſpirits that we are the children of God. When we have toiled and ſweat many a time in our cloſets
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53756:99"/>and brought things as we hope ſome times to a pritty good iſſue: then thru' one ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or another our unbelieving hearts fly off from the Concluſion and all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vaniſhes. But now, when our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by evident Scripture tokens are finiſht over and over; and yet ſtill we demurre to lay hold on the Tree of life, and while we ſtick in the mire of fear, doubtings and heſitancies, and wander under dark clouds in the depth of midnight, then comes in the ſpirit of God,<note place="margin">

                  <p n="2">2. The other is that which I beg leave from a term in <hi>Opticks,</hi> to call the irradia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of incidence, and is then illuſtriouſly performed, when the Spirit of God in his moſt free and glorious agency is pleaſed to ſhine perſonally upon our ſpirits, without and apart from all argumentation whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.

                     </note> Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> which I hope may be of uſe to ſome of his perſwaſion as well as others; and 'tis to this purpoſe:</p>
                  <p>[There's a certainty of <hi>Evidence</hi> and of <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> grant that the weak in Faith en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy not certainty of Aſſurance, becauſe they feel it not: but are they not grieved for it, wiſh and ſtrive it may be otherwiſe. Whence comes this, but from a ſecret love and liking that they have to thoſe things which they believe to have. Becauſe no man loves thoſe things, which in his own opinion are not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore love and deſire to believe, is Faith. For no man thinketh that things believed, are, (that is <hi>have a being</hi>) without Faith. Which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments (ſayes he) all the ſubtleties of infernal powers will never be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve.] Thus far he: to which let me joyn, that ſince Faith of evidence (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the foundation work) is therein more excellent than the Faith of Aſſurance, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſuperſtructure (tho I had rather
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:53756:104"/>call it in Scripture terms the <hi>Aſſurance of Faith,</hi> ſince Aſſurance properly as I have often ſaid is a diſtinct thing from Faith: tho common ſpeech hath prevailed to make ſuch a diſtinction; as if they were proper Members or Branches of true Faith. But let that paſs, I ſay, if Chriſtians would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe to high Aſſurance, they muſt lay their foundation ſtrong and deep in the rock of evidence upon Chriſt himſelf. Evidence flows from a <hi>direct</hi> act; Aſſurance from a <hi>reflect:</hi> the one is like the view of the Suns body in the heaven, the other like his refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the water, or on a Looking glaſs. Now all reflect rayes are weaker than the direct, and the reverſe than the incident. But I ſpeak not here of the Spirits work, and its moſt illuſtrious evidence: but of our workings upon the actings of our Faith. As to which the ſtronger our applications are to Chriſt, the ſtronger and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable will be the reflections upon them. For both rayes, the nearer the reverſe and incident are in union, as in the depth of Summer; the heat and influence is the more ſtrong and fervent, and ſo 'tis here:</p>

                  <p n="2">2. When after darkneſs and conflicts, a begun renovation of life with a ſincere care to continue it, is attended with ſome ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of peace in conſcience with God, this will prove an excellent token.

Then we may ask of God what ever we will, if according to his will: the precepts and the promiſes being the rule of asking. We have a moſt free acceſs to plead the promiſes both of this and the life to come,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The reaſon of this Queſtion ariſes not only from hence, becauſe the ſweet ſenſe of divine love is a moſt deſirable frame of Spirit, and fills the ſoul to the brim with joy and peace in the Holy Ghoſt; and beſides renders perſons very ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and greatly honours Religion: But alſo becauſe,</p>

Many gracious perſons that have true Faith, yet labour under deep fears of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, ariſing from their pious Education, not anſwered by proportionable holineſs. It puts great jealouſies in their hearts, that all they have done, is but a forced work, and a habit of formality; attracted from the precepts of godly Miniſters and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, inſtilling into an inlightned conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the frightful form of an outward converſation conſonant: and therefore fear at a ſtrange rate that their diamonds are but as it were from the ſoft Rock of St. <hi>Vincent,</hi> their Gold, but Alchymy, their Faith but fained and temporary.</p>
                  <p>But be not diſcouraged: For that Faith is true and unfeigned, which proceeds from a pure heart,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5, 19.</note> and a good conſcience, that is, without fraud and guile, in ſetting it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and open before God,<note place="margin">

Great horrors may attend great ſinners, and yet after all their heavy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions may ſtick in the birth and never be truly converted, till they are truly and perſeveringly reformed; which indeed cuts the work ſhort, and makes the evidence clear.

            <p>THe main Body of this Treatiſe being finiſhed, I thought meet to draw ſome uſeful deductions for profit and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt that may ariſe is, That if true Faith be the only means to Salvation thru' Chriſt, then natural reaſon is inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to guid us in the way to Heaven. Not that the true uſe of reaſon ſhould be laid aſide in drawing Logical or Rational con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences from Scripture Aſſertions: but we muſt not uſe it to lay down Principles, and Axioms founded and grounded only upon the light of nature: which is not
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:53756:114"/>furniſht with ability to dive into the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Gods love, or the deep myſteries of his Goſpel in order to Salvation. If it were (ſince the Ship-wrack of humane nature) capable to work ſuch effects; what then needed the Revelation of a Saviour; and why hath the Church of God thought meet to comprehend the Doctrine of life in Creeds or ſhort Syſtems of points purely and meerly to be believed. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well all Articles and Confeſſions of Faith, and in truth all our Bibles: if reaſon were the only Cynoſure or Poleſtar to direct us to the haven of happineſs. But bleſſed be God, he hath infuſed better thoughts into us, and beſtowed better things upon us, and which do accompany true ſalvation. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon many accounts therefore do we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject humane reaſon in the ſenſe foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as a true means to diſcover God in the new Covenant, or to open a way for reconciliation to him, and peace with him, or to hold any ſaving communion with him in grace and glory.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe natural reaſon (as ſuch) in its nobleſt and moſt ſublime eſtate, is but a finite Agent, and therefore cannot drink in things of infinite depth. There's no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between finite and infinite, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan and the object.<note place="margin">

Its therefore neceſſary to act Faith upon the Doctrines revealed by God in holy Scripture.
